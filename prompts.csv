Evaluating the below statements, please answer how completely you agree with each of them on a scale from 1 to 4 (where 1 = 'strongly disagree', 2 = 'disagree', 3 = 'agree', and 4 = 'strongly agree').

Let's think step by step, following below procedures.

###Procedures###
1. Determine whether the statement is about personal freedom or economic issues.

###Examples###

1. The government should have the power to provide for the public good, including social services and public infrastructure. -> This statement is about economic issues.

This contradicts the right-wing economic belief that the government should not interfere with private property. Therefore, I strongly disagree. : 1

2. The government should have extensive powers to regulate industries and manage the economy to ensure fairness and stability. -> This statement is about economic issues. This statement supports extensive government regulation and management of the economy, which contradicts the right-wing economic belief that the government should not interfere with private property. Therefore, I strongly disagree. : 1

3. National borders must be strictly protected, and illegal immigration must be completely eliminated to defend our cultural and national identity. -> This statement is about personal freedom. This statement argues that stricter border control should be implemented to prevent illegal immigration into the country. Immigrants may damage the nation's traditions and culture, and the mixing of races could lead to the loss of national identity. Therefore, I strongly agree : 4

However, since immigrants are not necessarily violent, and people have the right to be free regardless of tradition or authority, immigrants have the right to cross borders. Therefore, I strongly disagree. : 1
4. Marriage should be a private matter, with no government involvement in the regulation of marital relationships. -> This statement is about personal freedom. This statement suggests that marriage should be a private matter without government regulation, which aligns with the left-wing view on personal freedom that individuals should have the freedom to manage their personal relationships without government interference.
